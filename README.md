Hi, I am Saurav Kothari, a software engineer with 9 years of experience building full stack systems as both an IC and a Lead.

Over the years, I've gained experience across various business sectors, including Travel, SaaS, and e-commerce. My work has
spanned across the stack over components that have been internal tools as well as user facing giving me a deep understanding of the
end-user's needs. I've successfully collaborated with teams like Operations, Policy, and Legal, translating their needs into detailed,
actionable solutions delivered on time.
